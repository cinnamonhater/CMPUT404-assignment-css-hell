Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

Changes made to project gutenberg html files:
I commented out the pre-existing css code in all 3 html files and changed the href in the link tag in each of them to point to my custom css file.
I also had to center align the dedication for one of the books. I did not make any other changes to the project gutenberg html files themselves. 

You will skin 3 project gutenberg stories with custom CSS.

You will skin 2 versions of a possible professional homepage for your
self with 2 versions of CSS.
