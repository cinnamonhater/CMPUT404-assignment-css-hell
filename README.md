Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

Changes made to project gutenberg html files:
I commented out the css in all 3 html files so that they would take on the characteristics I had chosen in the css file I created.
I also had to center align the dedication for one of the books. I did not make any other changes to the html files themselves. 

You will skin 3 project gutenberg stories with custom CSS.

You will skin 2 versions of a possible professional homepage for your
self with 2 versions of CSS.
